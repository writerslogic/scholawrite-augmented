# Terminology Contract  
**ScholaWrite-Augmented**

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This document defines the authoritative terminology for the **ScholaWrite-Augmented** project.  
Its purpose is to prevent conceptual drift, misinterpretation, and inappropriate reuse by fixing a shared vocabulary centered on **process integrity and authorship defense**, rather than post-hoc attribution or AI detection.

All dataset annotations, schemas, evaluation metrics, documentation, and paper claims **MUST** adhere to this contract.

This document is normative, not descriptive.

---

## 2. Foundational Principle

**ScholaWrite-Augmented does not attempt to determine whether text was written by a human or generated by an AI system.**

Instead, the project studies whether the *observable revision process* of a document is consistent with iterative human authorship, or whether it exhibits evidence of **process-inconsistent external insertion**.

Claims about cognitive origin, intent, or tool usage are explicitly out of scope.

---

## 3. Canonical Terms (MANDATORY)

The following terms have precise meanings within this project and MUST be used consistently and exclusively.

### 3.1 Writing Process
The ordered sequence of revisions, edits, and transformations through which a document evolves over time.

Includes:
- insertions, deletions, rewrites, reordering
- hesitation, resistance, and refinement
- temporal spacing between revisions

Excludes:
- claims about mental states, intent, or authorship identity

---

### 3.2 Process Integrity
The degree to which a document’s final state can be coherently explained by a continuous, revision-consistent writing process.

Process integrity is:
- **graded**, not binary
- compatible with assistance
- compatible with ambiguity

---

### 3.3 External Insertion
Text introduced into a document from outside the ongoing revision process.

External insertion is a **descriptive event**, not a judgment of legitimacy, intent, or tool use.

---

### 3.4 Opaque External Insertion
A subtype of external insertion in which content appears:
- abruptly,
- without proportional intermediate revisions,
- and without observable integration work in the revision trace.

Opaque external insertion is defined **purely at the process level**.

---

### 3.5 Assistive Use
Use of external tools (including LLMs) in a manner that is:
- iterative,
- selectively adopted,
- and visibly integrated through subsequent revisions.

Assistive use is considered **process-consistent**.

---

### 3.6 Injective Use
Introduction of externally generated content as a largely intact span that undergoes minimal or no assimilation through the revision process.

Injective use is a **subset** of opaque external insertion.

---

### 3.7 Revision Assimilation
The gradual transformation of externally inserted content through subsequent revisions such that:
- boundaries erode,
- stylistic alignment increases,
- attribution becomes increasingly indeterminate.

Assimilation is explicitly modeled and annotated in this dataset.

---

### 3.8 Process Anomaly
Any deviation from expected revision dynamics, including but not limited to:
- opaque external insertion
- missing or collapsed revision intervals
- abrupt large diffs without intermediates
- timestamp irregularities

A process anomaly is **not equivalent to AI use**.

---

### 3.9 Indeterminate Case
A document, revision, or span for which multiple explanations remain plausible given the available process evidence.

Indeterminacy is a **valid and expected outcome**, not an error condition.

---

## 4. Prohibited Terminology (MUST NOT BE USED)

The following terms are explicitly disallowed because they collapse process-level analysis into origin claims or invite punitive interpretation.

These terms MUST NOT appear in:
- dataset labels or fields
- annotations
- evaluation metrics
- paper claims or conclusions
- documentation outside of contextualized discussion of prior work

❌ *AI-generated text*  
❌ *Human-written text*  
❌ *Ground-truth authorship*  
❌ *AI detection* (except when referring to prior literature)  
❌ *Cheating*, *plagiarism*, *fraud*  
❌ *Proof of AI use*

If such terms appear in citations, they must be explicitly framed as **external terminology not adopted by this project**.

---

## 5. Conditionally Allowed Phrases

The following phrases may be used **only when carefully qualified and never as labels**:

- *Externally generated content*  
- *Model-assisted writing*  
- *LLM-mediated suggestions*

These phrases MUST NOT be treated as ground truth or used to imply origin certainty.

---

## 6. Labeling and Annotation Policy

All annotations MUST:
- describe **events, spans, or process behaviors**
- avoid attribution of intent, agency, or authorship identity
- permit partial, overlapping, or ambiguous explanations

Binary labels (e.g., AI vs human) are explicitly prohibited.

---

## 7. Evaluation and Reporting Constraints

Evaluation language MUST:
- report **evidence surfaced**, not determinations made
- foreground false positives, disagreement, and ambiguity
- avoid language implying automated judgment or enforcement

Acceptable:
> “Method X highlights revision discontinuities correlated with opaque external insertion events.”

Unacceptable:
> “Method X detects AI-generated text.”

---

## 8. Intended Use and Non-Use

This terminology contract binds all uses of the dataset within this project.

The dataset is **not intended** for:
- punitive or automated enforcement
- sole authorship determination
- high-stakes decision-making without human review

Reframing the dataset as a binary detection tool is **out of scope**.

---

## 9. Rationale

This contract exists because:
- authorship disputes are socio-technical, not purely statistical
- revision-level evidence cannot support claims of cognitive origin
- responsible assistance must be distinguishable from misrepresentation without stigmatization

---

## 10. Versioning and Immutability

This terminology contract is **versioned and immutable per dataset release**.

Future revisions MUST:
- preserve backward conceptual compatibility, or
- explicitly declare a breaking change in framing.

---

## 11. Canonical Project Statement

> **ScholaWrite-Augmented studies process integrity, not author identity or tool origin.**
